# webServer
This repository hosts the codebase for a lightweight HTTP server implementation coded in java.
Designed for simplicity and efficiency, the server efficiently handles incoming HTTP requests and serves static content to clients.


## how to run

````
make 
````
compiles and runs the code, then the http server should be up and running :)


navigate to your browser and enter:

````
http://localhost:12345 
````


## future ideas

- TODO: implement SSL/TLS support
- Implement multi-threading to handle multiple client connections. (thread pool?)
- API maybe?
- caching
- Other static types of files, images (.jpg, .png, .gif) ect.
- Add logging to track requests and basic analytics.
- I want to use this web server to host my website
- Dynamic content?
