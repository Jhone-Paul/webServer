# webServer
This repository hosts the codebase for a lightweight HTTP server implementation coded in java.
Designed for simplicity and efficiency, the server efficiently handles incoming HTTP requests and serves static content to clients.


## how to run 
``` make ```

compiles and runs the code, then the http server should be up and running :)

## future ideas

I want to use this web server to host my website
